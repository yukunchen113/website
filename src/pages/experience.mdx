# Experience

## **Guest Researcher**: *Max Planck Institute Intelligent Systems*
- Using hierarchical dependencies to advance unsupervised learning of disentangled representations
- Successfully pitched project to Max Planck Institute researchers at world-class ML conference (NeurIPS)
- Designed and created three novel hierarchical datasets to evaluate functionality of state-of-the-art models
- Created system to checkpoint and schedule training for multiple models in parallel, maximizing GPU usage

## **Software Intern**: *MDA Corporation*

### Deep Learning for Canadarm2 Mission Analysis
- Created the first deep learning project at MDA to accelerate Canadarm2 mission planning.

- Problem Tackled:
	- Worst-case mission planning operations require running many time-consuming, simulations of Canadarm2 dynamics to identify suitable speeds to maneuver the robotic arm given different payloads.
	- we applied deep learning to quickly estimate accurate initial speeds.

- Results of Successful Project
	- Model predicts accurate estimates for the optimal rates to move the arm when given mass properties and arm commands.
	- Predicted reduction in mission analysis time from 2-3 weeks down to 1-2 days.
	- This is the first project to use deep learning models to aid in mission planning, and demonstrates the potential of using deep learning methods in future programs

### SPIDER (formerly Dragonfly) NASA Tipping Point Project
- on-orbit satellite self-assembly project. 
- Worked with mechanical, electrical, controls, and software engineers on the creation of the robotic arm's end effector 
- Communicated to setup electrical testbed and wrote scripts to test if the end effector met the mechanical requirements.
