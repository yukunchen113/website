# Experience

## Max Planck Institute Intelligent Systems: Guest Researcher
- Using hierarchical dependencies to advance unsupervised learning of disentangled representations
- Successfully pitched project to Max Planck Institute researchers at world-class ML conference (NeurIPS)
- Designed and created three novel hierarchical datasets to evaluate functionality of state-of-the-art models
- Created system to checkpoint and schedule training for multiple models in parallel, maximizing GPU usage

## MDA Corporation: Software Intern
### Deep Learning for Canadarm2 Mission Analysis
- Created the first deep learning project to accelerate Canadarm2 mission planning.

- Problem Tackled
	- Current worst-case mission planning operations require running many time-consuming, simulations of Canadarm2 dynamics with various payloads to identify suitable speeds to maneuver the robotic arm 

- Results of Successful Project
	- Models predicts accurate estimates of the optimal rate to move the arm, given mass properties and arm commands.
	- Predicted reduction in mission analysis time from 2-3 weeks down to 1-2 days.
	- This is the first project to use deep learning models to aid in mission planning, and will also be a demonstration to show the potential of using deep learning methods in future programs

### Dragonfly NASA Tipping Point Project
- Worked with mechanical, electrical, controls, and software engineers on the end effector of the robotic arm for the NASA tipping point Dragonfly project, an on-orbit satellite self-assembly project. 
- Communicated to setup electrical testbed and wrote scripts to test if the end effector met the mechanical   requirements. 
- Proposed the methods learned to project manager, for a similar, separate project.
