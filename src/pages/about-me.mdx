# Hi! I'm **Yukun**

Efficiency is **key** in creating a reproducible system and maximizing utilization.

I enjoy writing **clean, reproducible, and pluggable software**. However, developing software isn't just that. It also provides a way of thinking to increase efficiency and focus. For example, I've created a personal scheduling system to help prioritize and finish multiple tasks efficiently. This system takes inspiration from core software concepts such as scheduling, documentation, and modularity.

I have also **researched machine learning** as a guest scientist at the Intelligent Systems Department of the Max Planck Institute (MPI). Since attending NeurIPS 2018, I have been interested in the unsupervised learning of disentangled representations. Though I have mainly focused on unsupervised techniques, [recent research](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1812.02230.pdf) has shown that we should move from a passive learning style to an active one. I believe that proper representations
of data will lead to efficiency, scalability,
[continual learning](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/8193-life-long-disentangled-representation-learning-with-cross-domain-latent-homologies.pdf), hierarchical learning, and interpretability.

I graduated from **McMaster University in Mechatronics Engineering**. McMaster Mechatronics places a focus mainly on the **software** side, where we study embedded software and HDLs. We also take standard software courses including control systems, data structures and algorithms, parallel computing, computer networks and security, operating systems and more! Additionally, we take mechanical courses such as robotics, mechanical vibrations, and dynamics. In terms of the electrical side, along with HDLs (Verilog) we have worked with electrical instrumentation and electricity and magnetism. 


# Some Non-Technical Facts About Me:

I like to play guitar, I've been playing guitar for quite a while. However, since I started playing casually, my repertoire became quite limited!

One of my favorite sports is boxing. I've trained in boxing for a year and a half, while I was an intern at MDA. I had needed to train my cardio and core strength and boxing is a great sport for that. It also teaches how to remain relaxed under pressure - sparring in the ring is very different from just hitting a punching bag!

I also like to travel (pre-coronavirus). Some of the places I have been to include Cuba, The Dominican Republic, US, England, France, Prague, Germany, Austria, and China. I've also road-tripped all around Canada.

Here's a picture I took of a goat in Alberta:
