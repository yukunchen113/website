# Hi! I'm **Yukun**

Efficiency is **key** in creating a reproducable system and maximizing utilization.

I enjoy writing **clean, reproducable, and pluggable software**. However, developing software isn't just that. It provides a way of thinking to increase efficiency and focus. For example, I've created a scheduling system which I follow in real life to prioritize and finish multiple tasks efficiently. This system takes inspiration from core software concepts such as scheduling, documentation, and modularity.

I have also **researched machine learning** as a guest scientist at the Intelligent Systems department of the Max Planck Institute (MPI). Since attending NeurIPS 2018, I have been interested in the unsupervised learning of disentangled representations. Though I have focused on unsupervised methods currently [this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1812.02230.pdf), it is mentioned that we should move from a passive learning style to an active one. I believe that finding proper representations
of your data is what will lead to efficient and scalable
[continual learning](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/8193-life-long-disentangled-representation-learning-with-cross-domain-latent-homologies.pdf), hierarchical learning, and interpretability.

I graduated from **McMaster University in Mechatronics Engineering**. At McMaster, Mechatronics is mostly on the **software** side, where we study embedded software and HDLs. Other studied standard software courses we take include: control systems, data structures and algorithms, parallel computing, computer networks and security, operating systems and more! I've also done mechanical such as robotics, mechanical vibrations, and dynamics. In terms of the electrical side, along with HDLs (Verilog) we have worked with electrical instrumentation and electricity and magnetism. 


# Some Non-Technical Facts About Me:


I like to play guitar, I've been playing guitar for quite a while. However, since I started playing causally, my repertoire became quite limited!

One of my favourite sports is boxing, trained in boxing for a year and a half, while I was on coop at MDA. I needed to train my cardio and core, and boxing is a great sport for that. It also teaches how to remain relaxed under pressure, sparring in the ring is very different from bag work!

I also like to travel. Some of the places I have been to include Cuba, The Dominican Republic, US, England, France, Prague, Germany, Austria, and China. I've also road-tripped all around Canada.


Here's a picture I took of a goat in Alberta:
