# Projects
Here are some of the projects I have done in the past, as well as some I am currently working on.

## HedgeHog
I designed and created an end-to-end parallelized algorithmic trading and backtesting platform. I've also optimized strategies to leverage suboptimalities created by human judgement during volatile markets. The goal is to find optimal market conditions for deployment and minimizing risk.

**Tech Stack:** Python, IB API, Questrade API, REST, Numpy, H5PY, matplotlib

## Website
A responsive personal website. A valuable skill to have is to be able to present your skills and build an professional image. A personal website provides a link to the world to be able to do so. Regardless of how great the technical strengths, these skills must be communicated. Similar to how a noisy or unreliable channel could alter the message.

**Tech Stack:** Figma, Netlify, ReactJS, JSX, CSS, HTML, styled components, framer-motion, gatsby

## Representation Learning
I believe the key to achieving human like intelligence in machines is to use a suitable abstract space for thought. Representation learning aims to create a meaningful abstract space to represent data.

### Disentangle
A library for creating disentanglement models.

**Tech Stack:** Python, H5PY, Numpy, Tensorflow, Matplotlib


### IntroVAE Reimplementation
Improving quality of generated images through an introspective manner. Combines the high quality generations of GANs while maintaining a latent representation of the images. 

**Tech Stack:** Python, H5PY, Numpy, Tensorflow, Matplotlib


### $\beta$-VAE Reimplementation:
Introduces disentanglement into the VAE structure, throught a very simple tuning of a parameter, $\beta$. $\beta$ controls the effect of the regularization term, which can constrain the latent space. Disentanglement aims to increase robustness and interpretability in these neural network models.

**Tech Stack:** Python, H5PY, Numpy, Tensorflow, Matplotlib

## Knowledge Graph
My knowledge graph is something that I'm continuously updating. In the future, I will integrate it into this site to visually display a knowledge network.
I'm using obsidian.md as a wiki to organize my notes. 

I aim to take a Breadth First Search of knowledge approach since:
- understanding the overall scope will allow me to understand and contrast different topics
- easier to remember as constantly reviewing the topic and going deeper
	- allows review of topic with fresh mind, asking questions to break current understanding
- allows brainstorming without constraining thought process
