# Projects:

## **HedgeHog**
Designed and created an end-to-end parallelized algorithmic trading and backtesting platform. I've also optimized strategies which leverage suboptimalities created by human judgement during volatile markets. The goal is to find optimal market conditions for deployment, minimizing risk.

<span style="color:white;font-weight: 500;">Tech Stack:</span> Python, IB API, Questrade API, REST, Numpy, H5PY, matplotlib

<br/>

## **Website**
A responsive personal website. A valuable skill to have is to be able to present your skills and build a professional image. Personal websites are links to the world which facilitating this presentation. Made with ReactJS functional components.

<span style="color:white;font-weight: 500;">Tech Stack:</span> Figma, Netlify, ReactJS, JSX, CSS, HTML, styled components, framer-motion, gatsby

## **Representation Learning**
I believe the key to achieving human like intelligence in machines is to use a suitable abstract space for thought. Representation learning aims to create a meaningful abstract space to represent data. Here are the projects I have done towards representation learning.

### **Disentangle**
A library for creating disentanglement models. Provides an easy-to-use interface towards reproducibility.

<span style="color:white;font-weight: 500;">Tech Stack:</span> Python, H5PY, Numpy, Tensorflow, Matplotlib
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

### **IntroVAE Reimplementation**
Improving quality of generated images in an introspective manner. Combines the high quality generations of GANs while maintaining a smooth latent representation traversal as per VAEs. 

<span style="color:white;font-weight: 500;">Tech Stack:</span> Python, H5PY, Numpy, Tensorflow, Matplotlib 
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

### **$\beta$-VAE Reimplementation**
Introduces disentanglement into the VAE structure by tuning a parameter, $\beta$. $\beta$ controls the effect of the regularization by constrains the capacity of the latent space. Disentanglement aims to increase modularity, robustness, and interpretability in neural network models.

<span style="color:white;font-weight: 500;">Tech Stack:</span> Python, H5PY, Numpy, Tensorflow, Matplotlib

## **Knowledge Graph**
My knowledge graph is something that I'm continuously updating. In the future, I will integrate it into this site to visually display a knowledge network.
I'm using obsidian.md as a wiki to organize my notes. 

I aim to take a Breadth First Search approach since:
- understanding the overall scope will allow me to understand and contrast different topics
- it's easier to remember by constantly reviewing the topic and going deeper
- allows brainstorming without constraining your thought process
